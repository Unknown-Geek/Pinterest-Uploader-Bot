## 🔧 Original Issues Fixed

### 1. **Board Selection Failures** ✅ SOLVED

- **Problem:** Original code couldn't reliably select Pinterest boards
- **Solution:** Implemented multiple fallback methods:
  - Data-test-id attribute detection
  - Text-based board matching
  - JavaScript DOM manipulation
  - Enhanced retry mechanisms

### 2. **Description and Links Not Getting Added** ✅ SOLVED

- **Problem:** Pinterest's Draft.js editor wasn't being handled properly
- **Solution:** Comprehensive approach:
  - Draft.js editor support with innerHTML injection
  - Multiple textarea/input field detection
  - Aria-label and placeholder-based field identification
  - JavaScript fallback methods for all content types

### 3. **Publish Button Not Being Pressed** ✅ SOLVED

- **Problem:** Publish button detection was unreliable
- **Solution:** Multi-method detection:
  - Text-based button finding ("Publish", "Save")
  - Color-based detection (Pinterest's red button)
  - CSS selector fallbacks
  - JavaScript click simulation

- `set_description()` - Draft.js editor support + traditional methods
- `set_link()` - Comprehensive link field detection
- `select_board()` - Enhanced board selection with retry mechanisms
- `publish_pin()` - Multi-method publish button detection

### Fallback Strategy:

Each critical operation has 2-4 different approaches to ensure maximum reliability.
