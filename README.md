```python
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = 'custom_uploads'
```

### Logging Configuration

Adjust logging levels in `app.py` and `pinterest_automation.py`:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)  # For verbose output
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Login Problems

**Symptoms:** Login fails or hangs

```
Solutions:
✅ Verify credentials are correct
✅ Disable 2FA temporarily (not supported)
✅ Clear browser data/cookies
✅ Try running in non-headless mode
✅ Check for Pinterest security notifications
```

#### 2. Element Detection Failures

**Symptoms:** "Could not find element" errors

```
Solutions:
✅ Pinterest updated their website - automation will adapt
✅ Check debug screenshots in project folder
✅ Verify internet connection stability
✅ Update Chrome browser to latest version
```

#### 3. Upload Failures

**Symptoms:** Image upload doesn't work

```
Solutions:
✅ Ensure image is under 16MB
✅ Use supported formats (PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, WEBP)
✅ Check file isn't corrupted
✅ Verify sufficient disk space
```

#### 4. Board Selection Issues

**Symptoms:** Board not found or selected

```
Solutions:
✅ Use exact board name (case-sensitive)
✅ Ensure board exists in your Pinterest account
✅ Check board isn't private/restricted
✅ Try creating a new test board
```

### Debug Features

#### Screenshot Capture

Automatic screenshots are saved when errors occur:

- `board_dropdown_debug_*.png` - Board selection issues
- `publish_debug_*.png` - Publish button problems
- `final_publish_failure_*.png` - Upload failures

#### Verbose Logging

Check `pinterest_bot.log` for detailed operation logs:

```bash
tail -f pinterest_bot.log  # Monitor real-time logs
```

#### Test Mode

Use individual test functions:

```python
# Test login only
result = pinterest_bot.test_login(email, password)

# Get available boards
boards = pinterest_bot.get_user_boards(email, password)
```
