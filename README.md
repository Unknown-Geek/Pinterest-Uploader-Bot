## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install Python dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Chrome WebDriver:**
   - Download ChromeDriver from [https://chromedriver.chromium.org/](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/)
   - Make sure it matches your Chrome browser version
   - Add ChromeDriver to your system PATH

## Usage

1. **Start the Flask application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your web browser and go to:**

   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. **Fill in the form:**

   - Pinterest email and password
   - Upload your image
   - Enter pin title and description
   - Specify the board name
   - Add destination link (optional)

4. **Test login** (recommended) before uploading

5. **Click "Upload Pin"** and wait for the process to complete

## Configuration

### Headless Mode

To run the browser in headless mode (no GUI), modify `pinterest_automation.py`:

```python
pinterest_bot = PinterestAutomation(headless=True)
```

### Custom Upload Directory

Change the upload directory in `app.py`:

```python
app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = 'your_custom_uploads_folder'
```

## How It Works

1. **Login Process**: Uses Selenium to navigate to Pinterest and log in
2. **Image Upload**: Finds and interacts with Pinterest's pin builder
3. **Content Setting**: Uses multiple methods to set title, description, and links
4. **Board Selection**: Locates and selects the specified board
5. **Publishing**: Finds and clicks the publish button
6. **Verification**: Checks for success indicators

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **ChromeDriver not found**

   - Make sure ChromeDriver is installed and in your PATH
   - Check that the version matches your Chrome browser

2. **Login fails**

   - Verify your Pinterest credentials
   - Check if 2FA is enabled (not currently supported)
   - Try running in non-headless mode to see what's happening

3. **Elements not found**

   - Pinterest occasionally updates their website structure
   - The automation includes multiple fallback methods
   - Check the console logs for detailed error information

4. **Upload fails**
   - Ensure image file is under 16MB
   - Check that the image format is supported
   - Verify board name exists in your Pinterest account

### Debugging

1. **Enable verbose logging** by setting the log level to DEBUG in `pinterest_automation.py`
2. **Run in non-headless mode** to see the browser actions
3. **Check the log file** `pinterest_bot.log` for detailed error information

## Security Notes

- **Never commit credentials** to version control
- Consider using environment variables for sensitive data
- The application stores credentials only temporarily during execution
- Uploaded images are automatically deleted after processing

## Limitations

- Does not support Pinterest accounts with 2FA enabled
- Board names must be exact matches
- Some Pinterest features may not be supported
- Rate limiting may apply for bulk uploads
